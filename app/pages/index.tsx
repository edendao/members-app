            Frontier Climate is like a Proactive Public Goods DAO with nearly $1B of capital staked,
            and founded by leaders from Stripe, Shopify, and Alphabet. They are the pioneer and
            rock-solid platinum standard for directly impacting our humanity&rsquo;s skill in freeze
            space-time CO<sub>2</sub> permanently into rocks.

            By default ETH is turned into stETH, and pledged towards Frontier Climate (as if it were
            a money lego). You should really check them out, their work is best in class.

            As Frontier Climate delivers these carbon assets we will tokenize them into Proof of
            Impact tokens based on the latest tonâ€¢year math (current thesis here) and airdrop them
            to EDEN holders.
